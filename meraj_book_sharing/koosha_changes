Hi EveryBody:
	i change meraj folder and  i add download option to this.
	first change the setting.py and then follow this path:
	books-->view.py-->change b1 and b2 according to the pdf that you have.
	
	the template that i've written is download.html 

	i will add upload option as soon as i can.
	(i think that you will not face to any error but if you recieve
	any error i am almost always on on my skype.)  	

	Koosha,
